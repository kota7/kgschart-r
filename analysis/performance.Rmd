```{r}
library(lineprof)
library(kgschart)
l <- lineprof(kgschart(system.file("extdata/leela-ja_JP.png",
                                   package = "kgschart")))
l
```

It seems the slowest function is "rgb_dist" function.

This function is a single line function as below.
If we can optimize this function, the overall process will become much more efficient.
```{r}
kgschart:::rgb_dist
```
